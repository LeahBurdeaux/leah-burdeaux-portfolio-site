    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>In 5th grade, my teacher had us all write step-by-step instructions for opening the classroom door, walking through the doorway, and then closing the door behind us again. She explained that she would grade us by following the directions exactly and seeing how far our directions could lead her through the process. It was a seemingly simple assignment, yet I was the only student in the class who successfully got her through the door and into the hallway with the door shut behind her.</p>

      <p>That’s the kind of systems thinker and writer I have always been.</p>
      
      <p>I bring decades of systems thinking, detailed research for writing projects, and a deep longing to see complex problems of the world solved in a just and equitable way to my UX Design and UX Writing. I am passionate about accessibility, designing for marginalized populations, and making the world a <em>kinder</em> place for everyone.</p>
      
      <p>I earned a Master’s degree in Theology in 2013, after successfully defending my thesis about the ethics of nonviolence. I have an extensive background in writing and delivering public talks about controversial theological topics for both in-person and podcast audiences. My Batchelor’s degree was focused on the interplay between philosophy and religion, and my Associate’s degree is in English.</p>
      
      <p>My wife and I have been married since 2001 and are the parents of three young adults, two of whom have Down syndrome. I am a transgender woman changing careers in her mid-40s, and I am obsessed with Vietnamese tofu dishes, I spend too much money on vinyl records, and  I love sci-fi books, movies, and television. I am a serial entrepreneur with a background in small package logistics and leadership, but I have always done creative work as well.</p>
