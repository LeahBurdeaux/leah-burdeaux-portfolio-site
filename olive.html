      <h2>The Problem Space</h2>
      <p>Children with special medical needs often have to see multiple specialists that are all part of different
        hospital systems, with different patient portals, and sometimes no patient portals at all. Keeping track of all
        of this information is a difficult task that usually falls on the moms of these kids who do not have an easy or
        effective way to share information between doctors.</p>
      <h2>The Solution: Olive Health</h2>
      <p>Olive Health acts as a hub for medical information for entire families and allows patients to visualize,
        analyze, and share that information in any way they choose. Olive Health connects to multiple patient portals,
        popular fitness and diet tracking apps, and gives patients the ability to upload files to their accounts easily.
      </p>
      <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
      <p>All of these parents have a lot on their plates, and most of them really struggle to find ways to keep up with
        the health information for their kids with special medical needs. Olive Health was intentionally focused on
        solving the most difficult issues our patients face in an easy, accessible way because I believe that
        <b>edge-case-focused design</b> leads to products and services that are excellent for <i>everyone</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>UX Research</h2>
    <p>I sat down with three moms of kids with special needs to talk about health apps. These interviews were very
      informative and helpful, and these moms are full of great ideas for how technology could be improving their lives
      but often, it is making their lives more difficult. To see the full presentation of insights gained through this
      research, click <a

    <h2>User Personas</h2>
    <p>In order to demonstrate my premise, that edge-case-focused design can create apps that serve everyone well, I
      used the above research to create three distinct user personas. I believe that solving the problems for the
      persona with the most roadblocks will naturally create an easy and joyful experience for the user with the least
      roadblocks. </p>

  <div>
    <h2>Designing a Solution</h2>
    <p>After gaining a deep understanding of the issues these moms (and my personas) were facing, I was ready to
      start coming up with solutions. The early iterations were bare, but I was able to test them and start making
      improvements. Throughout multiple iterations that grew in fidelity, and with input from peers and real-world
      test subjects, Olive Health became easier to use, more accessible, and a real candidate to address these moms'
      needs. </p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>A Baked-In Accessibility Feature</h2>
      <p>Olive Health was designed from the start with moms in mind, and I designed the primary functions of the app
        to be easily used with only one hand, allowing moms holding fussy babies the ability to access their
        information easily.</p>
      <p>This also allows disabled and temporarily disabled people to use the app easily.</p>
      <p>Future iterations will include a setting that allows users to choose between left-hand and right-hand
        modes, which would switch the orientation of the menu buttons.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Testing the Solution</h2>
      <p>Beginning with paper prototypes, and all the way through the high-fidelity digital prototypes, every step
        of the design went through extensive testing, peer review, and critique from experienced professionals. The
        primary screens went through 3 rounds of user testing, as well as peer review from fellow UX students and
        from fellow UX Designers in the User Experience Design group on LinkedIn. The Onboarding screens were
        preference tested on UsabilityHub. Every screen has been critiqued by my mentor and tutor at CareerFoundry.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Proving the Solution</h2>
      <p>Before we move on and start evaluating the wireframes and prototypes, let's remind ourselves that we are
        trying to solve the real problems that real users have (as represented by our personas). If we haven't
        solved those problems, there's no need to keep moving forward until we do. </p>

        </picture>
      </div>
      <p>I think we're on to something here. It looks like Olive Health does solve the problems of our personas, and
        it appears that my hypothesis about edge-case-first design is proving to be true. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Revising the Solution</h2>
      <p>I used both Adobe XD and Figma to design Olive Health before combining the artboards into Figma for the
        final prototype. Learning two different programs took longer than just learning one, but I feel more
        confident that I can find the right tool for any of the design tasks I will face in the future. </p>

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>I have always had strong opinions about things like UI Design and typography, but I have never felt
          particularly good at either (at least to my picky satisfaction), so this part of designing Olive Health
          was difficult for me. But, I know enough about Adobe Photoshop to be dangerous, and so little about
          Illustrator that I'm <i>really</i> dangerous, so I made my best attempt.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The final round of user testing led to some very disappointed moms who were wishing this app was going
          into development. It is rare that moms of kids with special needs feel heard or catered to in any
          meaningful way, and I am certain that if a company were to develop a product like this, they would have
          desperately loyal customers who get to reclaim their most valuable resource... time. </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Takeways</h2>
        <p>I have learned so much more than I anticipated I would through this process. I had to overcome fears of
          doing interviews via video, and being on camera, and I became proficient in new software with a steep
          learning curve. These are significant steps that prepare me to do UX Design in the real world. </p>
        <h3>Struggles</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perfectionism - I often forget that done is better than perfect (and not finished)</li>
          <li>I'm still learning to not internalize critiques of my work, but it's easier every day</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Joys</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating something that I am truly proud of</li>
          <li>Finishing a massive project despite the obstacles this year threw at me</li>
          <li>Achieving clarity about what I want to focus my UX career on</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Surprises</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>As an introvert, connecting with users was surprisingly rewarding</li>
          <li>I really enjoy the tedium and minutiae of editing wireframes and the text/content of the project</li>
        </ul>
